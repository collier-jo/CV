## Background 


An engaging, behaviour and test driven full stack developer, who has recently graduated from one of the UK’s leading bootcamps, [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). I place learning, accessibility and creativity as core drives for my Programming Practice. 

Graduating from UAL in 2017, I travelled down many different paths - from working in recruitment for a homeless charity to working in first line IT to being part of an exhibition at the Tate Modern.

I love problem solving, however tenuous this has been the main link between the various jobs and hobbies I have undertaken. 

In the past 3 years I have linked my creative brain with its alternative ways of thinking with analytical and systematic approaches, this has been the catalyst to me starting a new journey into programming.
