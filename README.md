## Background 
 
**MAKERS** 

I am a Full-Stack developer ....

I have recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) - 

I have recently completed training at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) (London's leading programming bootcamp), to learn best practices, tools and methodologies.
 
Graduating from UAL in 2017, I travelled down many different paths - from working in recruitment for a homeless charity to working in first line IT to being part of an exhibition at the Tate Modern. I love problem solving, however tenuous this has been the main link between the various jobs and hobbies I have undertaken. 

In the past 3 years I have linked my creative brain with its alternative ways of thinking with analytical and systematic approaches, this has been the catalyst to me starting a new journey into programming.
